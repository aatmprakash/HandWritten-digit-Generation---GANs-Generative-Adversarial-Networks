# Handwritten Digit Generation - GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)

This repository contains the implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model for generating realistic handwritten digits. GANs are a class of deep learning models that consist of two components: a generator network that produces synthetic data and a discriminator network that tries to distinguish between real and fake data.

## Introduction

Handwritten digit generation is an interesting area in the field of artificial intelligence and computer vision. GANs have shown remarkable success in generating realistic and high-quality images, making them suitable for generating handwritten digits. The goal of this project is to develop a GAN model capable of synthesizing new and realistic digit images.

The generator network learns to generate digit images that resemble real handwritten digits, while the discriminator network learns to differentiate between real digit images and the synthetic ones created by the generator. Through an adversarial training process, the generator and discriminator networks compete and improve over time.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the GAN model is the MNIST dataset, which is a popular benchmark dataset for handwritten digit recognition. It consists of a large number of grayscale digit images, each labeled with the corresponding digit. The dataset is included with the code in this repository.

## Model Architecture

The GAN model is composed of two main components: the generator and the discriminator.

The generator network takes random noise as input and generates synthetic digit images. It typically consists of several layers of convolutional and upsampling operations, gradually transforming the noise into realistic digit-like features.

The discriminator network, on the other hand, takes either a real digit image from the MNIST dataset or a synthetic image generated by the generator and tries to classify it correctly. It consists of several layers of convolutional and downsampling operations, aiming to learn the distinguishing features of real handwritten digits.

The generator and discriminator networks are trained together in an adversarial manner, with the goal of improving the quality of generated digit images over time.

## Installation

To use this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/aatmprakash/HandWritten-digit-Generation---GANs-Generative-Adversarial-Networks.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies. You can use `pip` to install them:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Before running the code, make sure you have installed the required dependencies.

To train the GAN model, run the following command:

```
python train.py
```

The model will begin training using the MNIST dataset and the specified hyperparameters. The trained generator and discriminator models will be saved for future use.

To generate new handwritten digit images using the trained model, run the following command:

```
python generate_digits.py --generator saved_models/generator.pth --num_digits 10
```

Replace `generator.pth` with the appropriate saved generator model checkpoint file. Adjust `num_digits` to generate the desired number of digit images.

## Results

The quality of the generated handwritten digit images can be subjective and may vary based on the model architecture, training parameters, and the complexity of the dataset. The results obtained from the trained model can be evaluated visually to assess the realism and diversity of the generated digits.

Generated digit images can be saved and used for various applications such as data augmentation, training other machine learning models, and educational purposes.
